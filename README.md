## Key Components

1. **RegisterForm.vue** <br/>The main form component where the student enters their details. It uses several Element Plus components to create input fields, validation rules, and buttons.

2. **App.vue** <br/>
   The root component that integrates and renders the UserLogin.vue component.

## Form Validation

The form uses Element Plus's built-in validation system to ensure that all fields are correctly filled out before submission:

- **Name:** Required and must be a valid string.
- **Age:** Must be a positive integer.
- **Course:** Must be selected from a list.

## Sample Data

When the form is successfully submitted, the data can be processed, stored, or logged. Here's an example of the data that might be collected:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 22,
  "birthday": "December 25, 1999",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "course": "Computer Science"
}
```

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3:** Frontend JavaScript framework
- **Element Plus:** UI library for Vue 3
